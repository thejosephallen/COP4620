This program, p1.py, performs the functions of a scanner/lexer for a C- compiler.
It takes as input C- source code, then outputs a list of tokens and a symbol table.
It works by iterating through a source file and trying to match sequences of
characters with a list of regular expressions that define the form of 
acceptable tokens. Unrecognized characters and invalid tokens are marked as errors.
Many errors can arise through poor use of spacing in the source code, e.g. 123abc, 
1.ab2, etc, but the program will catch most of them. When an error is encountered,
all subsequent characters up to whitespace or valid sybmols will be marked with the
error. Common sense source code spacing is advised.

Conventions:
- whitespace or valid symbols must separate valid tokens
- errors are marked up to whitespace or valid symboles
- IDs can consist of upper and lowercase letters
-
